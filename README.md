# Programming-Languages
Notes for different programming languages I learn. Mainly for personal use.

## Usage
- Most if not all the files are in markdown (.md). I recommened using a markdown reader to read the notes
- I used Obsidian to write the notes; all the links within the files are according to Obsidian syntax
- For tables, I have used a community plugin in Obsidian called Advanced Tables
